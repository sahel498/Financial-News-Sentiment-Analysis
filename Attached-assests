📊 Financial News Sentiment Analysis – AI System

This project is a cloud-native AI application designed to analyze the sentiment of financial news related to selected stock tickers. It utilizes a pretrained FinBERT transformer model to classify each news headline as positive, neutral, or negative, and presents the results in a dashboard interface.
🧠 Core Features
🧩 Backend (FastAPI)

    News Scraping: Scrapes recent financial news headlines for selected stock tickers using Yahoo Finance.

    Sentiment Analysis: Runs each headline through a FinBERT model (via HuggingFace Transformers).

    RESTful API Endpoints:

        /analyze: Accepts tickers and returns sentiment scores.

        /news: Returns the scraped raw news.

        /sentiment/csv: Downloads sentiment data as CSV.

    Logging: Integrated with MLflow (logging only, no training).

    Dockerized for isolated deployment.

📊 Frontend (Streamlit)

    Dashboard UI to:

        Select stock tickers.

        View headlines and sentiment results.

        Visualize trends over time.

        Filter by date or sentiment.
